1. You will be divided into following groups:
  1.1 CSS Group
  1.2 Handle Numbers Group
  1.3 Handle Operators Group
  1.4 Calculate Group
2. All groups will need to fork the repo that has the skeleton code built already
3. You will work together within the group as well as with other groups to create a working calculator
4. Make sure you constantly sync your repo as some groups would have finished their task and created a pull request
5. You will have to strategize with other groups and see what can be done in tandem and what needs to be prioritized
6. Once all the pull requests have been merged, the calculator should work as it does on our phones
